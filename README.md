# FavelaDetection

The project is structured into four key components:
1. ImageProcessing: Advanced image preprocessing techniques, including conversion to COCO dataset format for standardized data handling.
2. Training: Segmentation model training with multiple architectures:
    * SegFormer
    * UNet
    * ResUNet
    * ResUNet-A
3. Inference: Model prediction pipeline with segmentation result generation, accuracy calculation and performance metrics
4. ChangeDetection: boundary change detection for favelas (using LSTM)
